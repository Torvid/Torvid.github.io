description 	= Annoyed by the gryphon's intervention, Rednoise turned around and grabbed another one of the micros and rather unceremoniously crammed it deep inside Torvid's ass, causing unrepairable damage to the micro's spine in the process. He was then left to limp over to his remaining friends, deciding to try and stand over them to try protect them from further harm. He was shivering in fear, trying to come up with a solution that, most definitely, doesn't exist. And he knows it. And in fact, the giant wolf decided to sit down on him, ultimately pulverising the poor fur still stuck in his butt and severely crushing the ones under his chest. Torvid is entirely unable to prevent it, forced to feels his friends squeeze, snap, pop and slowly crunch into gore underneath him. \n\nGryphon is Torvid, Giant wolf is Rednoise, \n\nDrawn by the amazing Torakuta

His prayers go unanswered, being soon condemned to spend the short remainder of his life getting slowly and painfully digested inside the green wolf's stomach. \n\nGryphon is Torvid, Giant wolf is Rednoise, \n\nDrawn by the amazing Torakuta

The gryphon is mercilessly squeezed by the coils of MagPi's prehensile dick, his beak opening wide to draw in breath despite his painfully compressed ribcage. That's when the narrow tip of that cock would wedge itself into his beak and the warm, acrid contents of the bird's bladder are maliciously emptied right down his throat and right into his rapidly-swelling stomach. If it wasn't for Torvid's proud erection, one could even assume he was not enjoying this greatly degrading act. \n\nDrawn by MagPI

Torvid unable to fight back or even move, is doomed to expire beneath the dog, who's entirely able to feel the gryphon's heart slow down and stop under his heavy rump.

And as such, his desperate attempts at crawling out inevitably cause Eli to grow aroused and his swelling, throbbing shaft will inevitably shatter every single bone in Torvid's body against the tight, firm insides of his sheath. \n\nDrawn by MagPi

description 	= Monster hunting is a lucrative task, but it doesn't come without risks. Usually, adventurers found lacking end up devoured, incinerated or pulverised on the spot, but it's not unheard of of particularly malevolent creatures taking their time to snuff out their incompetent hunters. And as such, this unlucky wolf happened to stumble across one of these very creatures, which rapidly and effortlessly overwhelms him. Now disarmed and pinned, the canine is rolled onto his front, then pinned under the huge gryphon's flank. It's heavy. Very. Yet not enough to kill him outright, or even cut his breath down to zero. Instead, he'll spend the next several hours slowly expending all of his energy trying to breathe under Torvid's thigh, while the gryphon - who clearly has found an excellent way to spend the time - stares at him intensely. It's made even worse for the hunter when it turns out that the gryphon can not only understand his language, but also speak it. \n\n"It's getting hard to breathe, isn't it? You ought to make an effort if you don't want to pass out..." \n\n Says Torvid, his beak lighting up with a cruel yet satisfied grin as the wolf, with great effort, takes in a deeper breath. \n\n\"Very good. If you can survive the night, I'll let you go free." \n\n Torvid knows very well that there's no chance for him to survive, but dangling hope in front of his victims is what makes them try their best. And it's to their struggle and desperation that the sadistic beast strokes himself off to. The wolf would spend the rest of his greatly shortened life slowly yet inexorably crushed beneath Torvid's flank, while that thick shaft hanging over his head and the gryphon's deliberate, lustful strokes constantly reminding him that the beast was, without a doubt, enjoying his suffering. \n\nDrawn by MagPi

filename 	= TorvidSketch_F.jpg
description = Turns out Torvid's a terrible listener. That, or Elijah is just trying to find an excuse to torture the gryphon. Whatever the truth is, Torvid would find himself at the frankly lackulstre mercy of the royal bird, who didn't waste time to step onto his much smaller friend. His comparatively broad, heaby talons sank painfully into Torvid's stomach, squeezing a strained croak out of him. His guts would mold around that sole, ending up flattened against the floor beneath and crushed against his endangered spine. Still not satisfied, Elijah would carelessy catwalk on, bringing his other foot down on Torvid's chest to even out the pressure before lifting his talons up from his battered stomach. The gryphon's ribcage resisted for a few seconds, letting out a plethora of ominous crackles before giving in under the unforgiving weight. Eli would be able to feel himself sink deep into Torvid's chest with a sickening crunch, jettisoning the air out of his lungs and reducing his agonising mewlings to silence. And so, Torvid would be left to quietly sob in pain and horror as his head was now made resting place for that foot that had brutalised his stomach. He could feel the jay's talons drum against his skull, then the pressure mounted rapidly. Moments later, he was finally freed of his brief yet cruelly intense moments of agony. \n\nDrawn by Thaz.

In fact, Waffle would find himself strapped to the gryphon's sack by means of rope, ready to be worn like a far too small piece of loincloth over those sweaty, unwashed orbs. He's then carried around for the entirety of the day, yet never forgotten by the cruel, abusive gryphon. By the evening, Waffle was positively drenched in sweat and high on the revolting musk of the unkept beast. It had gotten so bad that once Torvid pressed him against a glass panel, two things would happen. First, his fur would release a huge amount of the greasy, filthy buildup of sweat that had accumulated during the day. Second, more of it would come out of his mouth, squeezed out of his stomach which was, without a doubt, bloated with it. For better or for worse, the mouse had inadvertently (or deliberately) ingested a generous amount of Torvid's slimy sweat. If Waffle expected to be released any time soon, he was wrong. \n\nDrawn by Vera-Panthera

description	= The folf padded quietly by the creekside. He enjoyed taking early morning walks, and by leaving the path he could enjoy the river and feel more alone with his thoughts, despite the nearby path and early morning park-goers. The sounds of the creek covered up all but the faintest remnants of people's conversations, and the trees concealed his walk nicely. The folf turned his head to the sound of a stick breaking, his thoughts interrupted with slight annoyance as he turned to meet whoever was about to disturb him. Instead, turning he faced a huge beast - a gryphon - with what looked like a devious grin on it's face. "Wh...wha?" The folf decided he must be hallucinating - "gryphon's aren't real!". Deciding the beast before him "didn't exist" did little to calm the folf's racing heart - his tail tightly tucked between his legs and body shaking nervously as he tried to hold in a pathetic whimper. \n\nThe gryphon, in a sudden movement, pounced, the thousands of pounds of rippling muscle pinning the folf down beneath razor sharp talons. Talons that slid smoothly to the folf's comparatively tiny throat before wrapping around it and starting to squeeze. The folf desperately kicked and struggled as the gryphon began strangling him. "Isn't this a beautiful spot, little fox?" The gryphon cooed, shifting his weight to a more relaxed position as he gazed down at his desperately struggling prey. "You and I sharing this moment, totally alone... This lovely creek perfectly hiding the sounds of you struggling helplessly in my talons...". The folf could not take a moment to wonder at the mythical beast talking, his lungs screamed for air and his thoughts were cloudy and filled with panic as he writhed in desperate helplessness. The gryphon's talons didn't budge. Finally the gryphon leaned in close, and whispered words that cut through the folf's panic like a knife through hot butter, as his heart filled with dread - "Your final moments only mine to enjoy"....\n\nDrawn by Loonertick, featuring Torvid and an Anonymous folf

description 	= The folf had started to slip away into unconsciousness - his mind a muddy, foggy, confused mess as his struggling became weaker and his muscles started to spasm. The gryphon noticed his prey about to give in, but he wasn't  about to allow the tiny mammal to slip away quite yet. He loosened his grip, amazing himself at how little force and effort it had taken to choke the fox. The fox's frailty exciting him, and beneath his belly he could feel his sheath harden as he began to leak pre, his tip pressed between the ground and his belly. The gryphon entirely released the folf's throat - enjoying the folf's gasping breaths. The gryphon rested his talons on the folf's chest and watched as the folf tried to recover his breath. The gryphon decided that the folf had had long enough to recover. He put a single talon in the side of the folf's mouth, ensuring it would stay open - and the gryphon opened his mouth, letting his long, prehensile tongue hang down loosely. Drool ran down his tongue and dribbled into the folf's open mouth. The folf tried to turn his head or close his mouth but the talon in his mouth controlled his head movement, holding it in place. The folf gagged as the thick, vile, awful saliva started to run into his mouth. He tried to spit but it was too thick, and he was laying on his back. The folf realized with horror he'd have to drink the gryphon's awful saliva. Closing his eyes, he took the first gulp. The folf realized with horror his mouth was still filling up. Drool began running out of his mouth and down his cheek as he tried to drink the thick saliva as quickly as he could. He had to breath. His lungs burned. He breathed in, immediately coughing and sputtering. He felt the giant gryphon gazing down at him and did the last thing he could think of, he looked up straight into the gryphon's eyes. Hoping that the massive beast would see his suffering and feel mercy for him. Instead the gryphon's eyes narrowed, and he looked excited by the folf's appeal to his mercy. The folf gurgled and sputtered as he tried to fight for a breath. Exhausted, he could do little more to struggle than kick off the ground with his foot - which was getting him nowhere beneath the weight of the gryphon's talons, which rested peacefully on his chest, fully relaxed. Again the folf began to feel himself slipping - but this time the gryphon's eyes narrowed and body rippled in anticipation, and the folf knew his captor had no intention to let him breath again. The gryphon, seeing the hope fade to helpless defeat in his prey's eyes, felt his member flare out to it's full length. This would be over soon.\n\nDrawn by Loonertick, featuring Torvid and an Anonymous folf

description 	= Coal should have seen it coming the moment his leash was tied to the leg of the table, but even if he did there was nothing he could have done to prevent it. He was ordered on all fours, then sat on by the comparatively massive gryphon. Gryphon who, going by what he was saying, fully intended to spend the entirely of the evening on his living, already faltering chair. And so, Coal would be left to struggle under Torvid's immense weight, his joints first, then his muscles rapidly starting to hurt and burn. The fear of him collapsing and the gryphon landing on his back was providing him with quite the motivation to try his best. His best, however, might not be enough. \n\nDrawn by Thaz\nGryphon is me, Canine is Coal.

filename 	= Illustration29ggg.png
description = "Jack, no, you can't do this!"\nUttered Maple, his voice managing to sound both imperative and distressed. The slender, orange gryphon and his blue conspecific were stuck under the talons of their comparatively far taller friend, who even sat down on the grassy ground effortlessly towered over them. In fact, the penguin that was currently exerting an uncomfortable amount of control over the two ferals was quite the imposing fellow, reaching just above seven metres in height and two and a half tonnes in weight.\n\n"I thought we were friends!"\n\nChimed in Torvid, the blue gryphon.\n\n"Oh, yes I can. Who's going to stop me, you?"\n\nReplied Jack, and rather condescendingly so. He was looking down at the two, their heads peeking between two of his black, webbed toes. His knees were bent with arms resting on top of them, soles down flat on the unlucky gryphons and the ground. This alone was enough to cause the two some pressure-related discomfort.\n\n"As a matter of fact, I don't think there's anyone that can help you, right now."\n\nHe continued with a chuckle, his icy-blue eyes brimming with self-satisfied, indulgent malice.\n\n"You have one chance to let us go, or els-HRRK"\n\nMaple's desperate attempt at sounding yet again demanding was effortlessly quashed by the bird, who didn't need to do much more than lean forwards a little and put some more weight onto him. Air rushed out of the gryphon's throat and nostrils as his lungs were flattened, the cartilage in his joints and ribcage popping under the pressure. Torvid could only stare impotently as his friend spent the following, long seconds unable to draw breath, eyes barred and lightly bulging from the pressure and beak clacking in a desperate attempt to down even a sliver of air. Only when his struggling and fight for oxygen started to wane did Jack finally let up, allowing the orange feral to fill his lungs with the dusty, leathery scent of the bird's talons.\n\nDespite the thick, leathery soles, the penguin could still very much feel what was going on beneath his paws. The brushing of fur and feather, the racing hearts of his friends, the way Maple's own slowed down as he was temporarily deprived of air paired with the fruitless spasms of his diaphragm. This, paired with the thrill of being able to so leisurely toy with their lives, was enough to get him going.\n\n"Or else, what? Sorry, I didn't quite get you."\n\nReplied the bird. Nobody had anything else to add.\n\n"That's what I thought."\n\nJack's hands then approached his paws and his victims beneath them, with what looked like some appropriately-sized fishing line. Appropriately sized for him of course, while it might as well have been a steel cable for the two gryphons who could stare right up at his greatly amused captor as he carefully grabbed their arms, forced them around the sides of his paw, and tied the wrists together.\n\nLittle would the somewhat incoherent pleas for mercy coming from both Maple and Torvid do to sway the penguin's ideas, no matter how many 'please' and 'I beg you' they could cram into them. Soon, they'd be just where the bird wanted them to be: their head was still stuck between two of his toes, with their entire torso covered by that heavy, leathery sole. The heel was pushing right into their groins, and their legs had been pulled up and tied at the back of Jack's ankle.\n\n"Ah, there we go. Nice and tight."\n\nSaid the penguin, commenting on his ropework while testing it out by slowly grinding the two gryphons back and forth into the grass and dirt.\n\n"Wouldn't want you to accidentally slip out from under there. It'd break my heart..."\n\nHis attention would then turn away from the well-secured insoles, with one of his hands reaching up to his beak. A subtle gulp was followed by a lump crawling up his throat, then a little ball of saliva-coated feathers would be gently deposited by his long, dexterous tongue into his open palm. A diminutive, white snowy owl, who had spent an unknown amount of time safely stored inside Jack's tight crop. Torvid and Maple would be able to see the penguin allow the candid raptor a few seconds to get his bearings before closing his hand around him, head poking out from the bottom and just his talons sticking out the top.\n\nHis blue eyes then fixated briefly on the gryphons, offering them a rather malevolent smile before getting himself up without a warning.\n\nThe two immediately quit their begging. Less so because they realised that Jack would not change his mind any time soon and more because their lungs had just been deprived of any singular particle of air. Even if the grass and the recently unpacked dirt beneath them were offering some give, it was nowhere close to being enough to bear over a ton of weight each. Their hipbones and coccyxes were the first to give in under the far less forgiving heel, splitting open with a sound and feel not too distant from how one cracks a chicken's chest for grilling. This allowed their legs to bend slightly more comfortably around said heel if they could manage to ignore the agonising pain of having a vital part of their skeleton turned to splinters and allowing it to sink further into their soft guts.\n\nIf the two could manage to focus on the bird above them, they'd likely immediately notice that his black, tapered cock was standing proudly against his immaculate, white feathers. The hand that held Smowl, the little owl, would end up pressed into it, with the front of the raptor unceremoniously pushed and smeared against its underside.\n\nAnd so, as the two gryphons slowly met their demise underneath the penguin, Jack would slowly rub himself off to it. He enjoyed their anguished expressions, their beaks wide open in a perpetual, silent, completely breathless scream of pain. He enjoyed how their skeletons popped and crackled at every light shifting of his bone-pulverising weight, with their ribs giving in with a sickening ripple of snaps, together with the collarbone. Their shoulder blades required some further convincing, with Jack leaning more heavily on the balls of his foot to achieve the desired result.\n\nWith little to no bones in their torso left intact, Jack could finally enjoy the soft, squishy feeling of their mushed insides, the vain struggle of their flattened lungs, and the gargantuan yet slowly fading effort put forth by their hearts to keep pumping blood under so much pressure.\n\nAnd as the two gryphons neared their excruciatingly slow death, the penguin would stroke himself off to their anguish, making sure to press Smowl's beak against the tip of his shaft moments before the climax. He'd be forced to swallow, his little body growing bloated with whatever he could take before spilling over and out of his throat. Stuffed like a cream-puff, the owl would not be granted time to recuperate before getting slurped up off of Jack's hand by his tongue, then dragged down the deep recesses of his throat.\n\nSpent and possibly satiated, the bird would look around for any most unfortunate onlooker before setting off for a leisurely walk, the crushed bodies of the two gryphons still very securely strapped beneath his soles.\n\n\nDrawn by Torakuta, Gryphons getting stepped on are Torvid and Maple. Owl stuck to dick is Smowl. Penguin is Jack.

description 	= As always, Torvid loves to positively terrorise his victims. The feeling he gets from toying with his prey, from picking apart their courage and feeding their fear might surpass the actual fulfillment of those acts in erotic intensity. Here we can see him pin his next victim down beneath his foretalon, whispering a list of ways he could kill him into his ear while lovingly nuzzling his cheek. The juxtapositon of these two things is enough to make the wolf cling onto some hope that, without a doubt, Torvid will figuratively and literally crush. \n\nDrawn by MagPi

description = Torvid chittered to himself in satisfaction. Between his talons, a tiny thing struggled to try to free itsself. Much to small to be even a snack, the gyphon could feel the terrified mammal through his talons, the small creature's heart beating hard and fast. Torvid grinned to himself as he felt the tip of his cock leave its sheath.\n\nThis creature felt so fragile - he marveled at its squirms and desperate kicks as it tried to free itself. "Shh" the gryphon muttered as he heard the fox yelp and whine in terror in his grasp. The gryphon shifted his weight, appyling the slightest bit of pressure to the tiny fox's chest. The fox's chest gave to his press - the fox's whimpering turning to a desperate gurgle, then a wheeze, and eventually silent thrashing as the air was forced from his chest. The gryphon's smile deepened as he felt a familiar warmth grow between his legs.\n\nThe gryphon began to purr - the purring was deep, resonating - like distant thunder it vibrated deep in the terrified folf's body - each purr filling him with a sense of terror and dread. For all his struggling, it was getting him nowhere - each time he made any progress against the incredible weight of the talons he would hear the purring intensify as the gryphon shifted his fingers to once again trap the fox. The gryphon didn't even need to exert any pressure on the poor little thing - the weight of his massive talons enough to easily trap the helpless creature.\n\n"You make a very cute plaything~" The gryphon cooed, nuzzling the soft fur on the folf's face with his hard, firm beak "Don't be nervous - you'll do just fine. Just try to stay awake as long as possible for me alright? Your little heatbeat will fade against my talons as your body relaxes in my grasp - but I'm not in any hurry. I intend to enjoy this fully, so please do your best to make this last as long as possible~". He began to toy with the folf - the weight and strength of his talons counterbalanced with the gryphon's precision and demeanor.\n\nThe gryphon was cuddling the fox. Rubbing himself against him, fondling his soft fluffy body gently in his talons - the tremendous talons of the gryphons were gentle, however very carefully and precisely they applied constant and gradually growing pressure around the fragile fox. The poor fox struggled and wheezed at the tightening around the tiny ribs, feeling each breath fill slightly less than the last.\n\nThe folf thrashed desperately - or at least he would be were he able to. Torvid could feel the fox's muscles doing their best to fight back, to escape - however to the massive gryphon, it was little more than a light sensation. To an outside viewer, the fox almost appeared to be snuggling the gryphon back. The talons moving the tiny folf's body involuntarily, forming it with powerful, affectionate snuggles as the gryphon lovingly caressed the small folf.\n\nThe gryphon begain massaging the folf's chest with his talons. Each application of pressure brought an exhalation of air, followed by gasping as the folf's chest was pressed nearly flat. The gryphon purred louder, fully erect now as he began gently fondling and nuzzling his companion. The gentle pressure of the giant gryphon's heavy, strong, massive talons made it hard to breath - and occasionally the folf made awful noises as the air was forced repeatedly from his chest. The folf faded in and out of consciousness. Occasionally the gryphon would press just slightly firmer, and a *pop!* or [i]*Cr-acK!* would come from the tiny, squirming and gasping fluff in his talons. Then the talons would relax - let the folf recover as the gryphon enjoyed the sounds of his prey.\n\nWith each sound, the gryphon's back hips could be seen making a subtle but firm thrust involuntarily - pre leaking out in spurts, thicker each time. The gryphon smiled. What a wonderful day.
