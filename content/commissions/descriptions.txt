The weight of Torvids flank alone enough to stop it from breathing. Tearing up and ghasping silently for air, whimpering in pain and humiliaton as torvids member grows to rest on its head. No qualms or hessitation about showing the wuff just how much, and in what way he's enjoying himself.\n\n "There there. You're going to have to strain harder than that to lift me and get a breath. Come on, use your whole body." The wuff closes its eyes, and musters up its last bit of strength to desperately try to lift the gryphons butt even a centimeter. "Mmhhh, just like that~ ", torvid says with a sadistic smile and moves a talon down between his legs, proceeding to pleasure himself to the sight of the wuff spending its last moments straining with all its might beneath him. \n\nDrawn by MagPi

Torvid slowly backs up against a large glass panel, pinning the dangling mouse between them, huffing as he feels the mouse get squeezed and compressed, his balls deforming and almost wrapping around the little mouse. \n\nWaffle gags and whimpers, the incredible scent of musky, slimy sweat all aound him makes him loopy, not knowing what to do with himself as the pressure and wetness increases, soaking his fur and face in it. \n\nEventually the mouse's fur gets completely saturated, unable to soak up any more of the sweat, but more sweat is still being produced by the gryphon, and so it starts to fill up the space around his neck, the level slowly rising around the mouse's head. Soon it reaches his mouth and nose, a slow tricke of slimy, greasy sweat seeping in through the corners of his mouth. The little mouse runt completely dominated by the distgusting gryphon-musk-liquid, both inside and out. \n\nDrawn by Vera-Panthera

filename 	= Abberate Loonertick 1 (fullsize) modified blush.png
description = The folf padded quietly by the creekside. He enjoyed taking early morning walks, and by leaving the path he could enjoy the river and feel more alone with his thoughts, despite the nearby path and early morning park-goers. The sounds of the creek covered up all but the faintest remnants of people's conversations, and the trees concealed his walk nicely. The folf turned his head to the sound of a stick breaking, his thoughts interrupted with slight annoyance as he turned to meet whoever was about to disturb him. Instead, turning he faced a huge beast - a gryphon - with what looked like a devious grin on it's face. "Wh...wha?" The folf decided he must be hallucinating - "gryphon's aren't real!". Deciding the beast before him "didn't exist" did little to calm the folf's racing heart - his tail tightly tucked between his legs and body shaking nervously as he tried to hold in a pathetic whimper. \n\nThe gryphon, in a sudden movement, pounced, the thousands of pounds of rippling muscle pinning the folf down beneath razor sharp talons. Talons that slid smoothly to the folf's comparatively tiny throat before wrapping around it and starting to squeeze. The folf desperately kicked and struggled as the gryphon began strangling him. "Isn't this a beautiful spot, little fox?" The gryphon cooed, shifting his weight to a more relaxed position as he gazed down at his desperately struggling prey. "You and I sharing this moment, totally alone... This lovely creek perfectly hiding the sounds of you struggling helplessly in my talons...". The folf could not take a moment to wonder at the mythical beast talking, his lungs screamed for air and his thoughts were cloudy and filled with panic as he writhed in desperate helplessness. The gryphon's talons didn't budge. Finally the gryphon leaned in close, and whispered words that cut through the folf's panic like a knife through hot butter, as his heart filled with dread - "Your final moments only mine to enjoy"....\n\nDrawn by Loonertick, featuring Torvid and an Anonymous folf

filename 	= Abberate Loonertick 2 edited blush extra effects.png
description = The folf had started to slip away into unconsciousness - his mind a muddy, foggy, confused mess as his struggling became weaker and his muscles started to spasm. The gryphon noticed his prey about to give in, but he wasn't  about to allow the tiny mammal to slip away quite yet. He loosened his grip, amazing himself at how little force and effort it had taken to choke the fox. The fox's frailty exciting him, and beneath his belly he could feel his sheath harden as he began to leak pre, his tip pressed between the ground and his belly. The gryphon entirely released the folf's throat - enjoying the folf's gasping breaths. The gryphon rested his talons on the folf's chest and watched as the folf tried to recover his breath. The gryphon decided that the folf had had long enough to recover. He put a single talon in the side of the folf's mouth, ensuring it would stay open - and the gryphon opened his mouth, letting his long, prehensile tongue hang down loosely. Drool ran down his tongue and dribbled into the folf's open mouth. The folf tried to turn his head or close his mouth but the talon in his mouth controlled his head movement, holding it in place. The folf gagged as the thick, vile, awful saliva started to run into his mouth. He tried to spit but it was too thick, and he was laying on his back. The folf realized with horror he'd have to drink the gryphon's awful saliva. Closing his eyes, he took the first gulp. The folf realized with horror his mouth was still filling up. Drool began running out of his mouth and down his cheek as he tried to drink the thick saliva as quickly as he could. He had to breath. His lungs burned. He breathed in, immediately coughing and sputtering. He felt the giant gryphon gazing down at him and did the last thing he could think of, he looked up straight into the gryphon's eyes. Hoping that the massive beast would see his suffering and feel mercy for him. Instead the gryphon's eyes narrowed, and he looked excited by the folf's appeal to his mercy. The folf gurgled and sputtered as he tried to fight for a breath. Exhausted, he could do little more to struggle than kick off the ground with his foot - which was getting him nowhere beneath the weight of the gryphon's talons, which rested peacefully on his chest, fully relaxed. Again the folf began to feel himself slipping - but this time the gryphon's eyes narrowed and body rippled in anticipation, and the folf knew his captor had no intention to let him breath again. The gryphon, seeing the hope fade to helpless defeat in his prey's eyes, felt his member flare out to it's full length. This would be over soon.\n\nDrawn by Loonertick, featuring Torvid and an Anonymous folf

filename 	= Illustration29ggg.png
description = "Jack, no, you can't do this!"\nUttered Maple, his voice managing to sound both imperative and distressed. The slender, orange gryphon and his blue conspecific were stuck under the talons of their comparatively far taller friend, who even sat down on the grassy ground effortlessly towered over them. In fact, the penguin that was currently exerting an uncomfortable amount of control over the two ferals was quite the imposing fellow, reaching just above seven metres in height and two and a half tonnes in weight.\n\n"I thought we were friends!"\n\nChimed in Torvid, the blue gryphon.\n\n"Oh, yes I can. Who's going to stop me, you?"\n\nReplied Jack, and rather condescendingly so. He was looking down at the two, their heads peeking between two of his black, webbed toes. His knees were bent with arms resting on top of them, soles down flat on the unlucky gryphons and the ground. This alone was enough to cause the two some pressure-related discomfort.\n\n"As a matter of fact, I don't think there's anyone that can help you, right now."\n\nHe continued with a chuckle, his icy-blue eyes brimming with self-satisfied, indulgent malice.\n\n"You have one chance to let us go, or els-HRRK"\n\nMaple's desperate attempt at sounding yet again demanding was effortlessly quashed by the bird, who didn't need to do much more than lean forwards a little and put some more weight onto him. Air rushed out of the gryphon's throat and nostrils as his lungs were flattened, the cartilage in his joints and ribcage popping under the pressure. Torvid could only stare impotently as his friend spent the following, long seconds unable to draw breath, eyes barred and lightly bulging from the pressure and beak clacking in a desperate attempt to down even a sliver of air. Only when his struggling and fight for oxygen started to wane did Jack finally let up, allowing the orange feral to fill his lungs with the dusty, leathery scent of the bird's talons.\n\nDespite the thick, leathery soles, the penguin could still very much feel what was going on beneath his paws. The brushing of fur and feather, the racing hearts of his friends, the way Maple's own slowed down as he was temporarily deprived of air paired with the fruitless spasms of his diaphragm. This, paired with the thrill of being able to so leisurely toy with their lives, was enough to get him going.\n\n"Or else, what? Sorry, I didn't quite get you."\n\nReplied the bird. Nobody had anything else to add.\n\n"That's what I thought."\n\nJack's hands then approached his paws and his victims beneath them, with what looked like some appropriately-sized fishing line. Appropriately sized for him of course, while it might as well have been a steel cable for the two gryphons who could stare right up at his greatly amused captor as he carefully grabbed their arms, forced them around the sides of his paw, and tied the wrists together.\n\nLittle would the somewhat incoherent pleas for mercy coming from both Maple and Torvid do to sway the penguin's ideas, no matter how many 'please' and 'I beg you' they could cram into them. Soon, they'd be just where the bird wanted them to be: their head was still stuck between two of his toes, with their entire torso covered by that heavy, leathery sole. The heel was pushing right into their groins, and their legs had been pulled up and tied at the back of Jack's ankle.\n\n"Ah, there we go. Nice and tight."\n\nSaid the penguin, commenting on his ropework while testing it out by slowly grinding the two gryphons back and forth into the grass and dirt.\n\n"Wouldn't want you to accidentally slip out from under there. It'd break my heart..."\n\nHis attention would then turn away from the well-secured insoles, with one of his hands reaching up to his beak. A subtle gulp was followed by a lump crawling up his throat, then a little ball of saliva-coated feathers would be gently deposited by his long, dexterous tongue into his open palm. A diminutive, white snowy owl, who had spent an unknown amount of time safely stored inside Jack's tight crop. Torvid and Maple would be able to see the penguin allow the candid raptor a few seconds to get his bearings before closing his hand around him, head poking out from the bottom and just his talons sticking out the top.\n\nHis blue eyes then fixated briefly on the gryphons, offering them a rather malevolent smile before getting himself up without a warning.\n\nThe two immediately quit their begging. Less so because they realised that Jack would not change his mind any time soon and more because their lungs had just been deprived of any singular particle of air. Even if the grass and the recently unpacked dirt beneath them were offering some give, it was nowhere close to being enough to bear over a ton of weight each. Their hipbones and coccyxes were the first to give in under the far less forgiving heel, splitting open with a sound and feel not too distant from how one cracks a chicken's chest for grilling. This allowed their legs to bend slightly more comfortably around said heel if they could manage to ignore the agonising pain of having a vital part of their skeleton turned to splinters and allowing it to sink further into their soft guts.\n\nIf the two could manage to focus on the bird above them, they'd likely immediately notice that his black, tapered cock was standing proudly against his immaculate, white feathers. The hand that held Smowl, the little owl, would end up pressed into it, with the front of the raptor unceremoniously pushed and smeared against its underside.\n\nAnd so, as the two gryphons slowly met their demise underneath the penguin, Jack would slowly rub himself off to it. He enjoyed their anguished expressions, their beaks wide open in a perpetual, silent, completely breathless scream of pain. He enjoyed how their skeletons popped and crackled at every light shifting of his bone-pulverising weight, with their ribs giving in with a sickening ripple of snaps, together with the collarbone. Their shoulder blades required some further convincing, with Jack leaning more heavily on the balls of his foot to achieve the desired result.\n\nWith little to no bones in their torso left intact, Jack could finally enjoy the soft, squishy feeling of their mushed insides, the vain struggle of their flattened lungs, and the gargantuan yet slowly fading effort put forth by their hearts to keep pumping blood under so much pressure.\n\nAnd as the two gryphons neared their excruciatingly slow death, the penguin would stroke himself off to their anguish, making sure to press Smowl's beak against the tip of his shaft moments before the climax. He'd be forced to swallow, his little body growing bloated with whatever he could take before spilling over and out of his throat. Stuffed like a cream-puff, the owl would not be granted time to recuperate before getting slurped up off of Jack's hand by his tongue, then dragged down the deep recesses of his throat.\n\nSpent and possibly satiated, the bird would look around for any most unfortunate onlooker before setting off for a leisurely walk, the crushed bodies of the two gryphons still very securely strapped beneath his soles.\n\n\nDrawn by Torakuta, Gryphons getting stepped on are Torvid and Maple. Owl stuck to dick is Smowl.

description = "Jack, no, you can't do this!"\nUttered Maple, his voice managing to sound both imperative and distressed. The slender, orange gryphon and his blue conspecific were stuck under the talons of their comparatively far taller friend, who even sat down on the grassy ground effortlessly towered over them. In fact, the penguin that was currently exerting an uncomfortable amount of control over the two ferals was quite the imposing fellow, reaching just above seven metres in height and two and a half tonnes in weight.\n\n"I thought we were friends!"\n\nChimed in Torvid, the blue gryphon.\n\n"Oh, yes I can. Who's going to stop me, you?"\n\nReplied Jack, and rather condescendingly so. He was looking down at the two, their heads peeking between two of his black, webbed toes.
