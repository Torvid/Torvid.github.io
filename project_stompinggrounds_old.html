	<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
	
	<h5>What is the game about?</h5>
		You play as an Eagle, Sergal and Dragon from a top-down perspective, using abilities like stomp, throw, screech and fire-breath to kill invaders.
		
	<h5>Controls?</h5>
		The control-scheme is similar to Mobas like league of legends, but instead of a pvp arena it's a series of levels.

	<h5>What will the game cost?</h5>
		Free! (when it's done)
		If you want to play early builds of the game, I post those for $10 on my patreon, found here: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Torvid">https://www.patreon.com/Torvid</a>
		
	<h5>When is it coming out?</h5>
		Probably some time around mid 2021. (god willing)

	<h5>Where can I follow development, get updates?</h5>
		The best place is the public telegram channel or discord server where I post screenshots and clips of my this project and others: <br/>

		<a href="https://discord.gg/ZQpTQYZ">https://discord.gg/ZQpTQYZ</a>
		
	<h5>What platforms will it work on?</h5>
		Windows and Linux (tested on linux mint with an nvidia graphics card)

	<h5>How long have you been working on it?</h5>
		Since late 2018

	<h5>Will there be gryphons?</h5>
		Yes, yes there will be. :>
		
	<h5>How can I support you?</h5>
		For now, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Torvid">https://www.patreon.com/Torvid</a> Pretty much all the money I get here I put back into the project.
		
	<h5>Modding?</h5>
		There is no official support for mods, but if you want to decompile and mod the game, all power to you!
		If you want the source code / project files one the game is out, feel free to send me a message!
		
	<h5>Support / Versions?</h5>
		I will release the game and that's it. I'll only patch or update it if some critical, game-breaking problems are discovered. (like the game not working at all on some machines)
		
	<h5>Your last game was made in Unreal, Why return back to Unity?</h5>
		I got sick of the visual scripting working on the barn game. My initial prototypes for this game were actually in unreal! But I realized doing the dynamic mud would probably require modifying the engine itself, which sounded scary at the time.
