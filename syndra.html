<h2>Operation</h2>
<hr/>
<b>How do I change program?</b><br/>
Press one of the two buttons on the back.<br/>
<br/>
<b>How do I change the text?</b><br/>
1. Hold down one of the two buttons, An animation will play.<br/>
2. After a couple seconds, the badge will generate a wifi network. Connect to it with your phone or other device.<br/>
3. A settings menu will appear, change settings here and click "Done".<br/><br/>

<h2>How did this all happen?</h2>
<hr/>
At NFC 2023 I got to talking with TomTheDragon, who had a fun LED badge with scrolling text. We got to talking about how there's no RGB ones, wondering how easy it might be to build one from scratch.<br/><br/>

Sooooooo I decided to go ahead and try it, almost on a dare, hoping that the idea of doing something impossible would keep me motivated<br/><br/>

Since I knew next to nothing about electronics, I started harassing Maple (who is a product engineer) with a million questions about electronics, PCB (Printed Circut Boards) design, power circutry, LEDs, Microcontrollers. And with way, waaaaay more confidence than warranted I just kind of went for it. A common pattern here became maple explaining something, me drawing some conclusions and going for it <b>immedietly</b> without asking further questions or listening to his warnings.<br/><br/>

<h3>uuuhhh</h3>
At first I was planning on powering it with two AA batteries, and designed a test board with a bunch of different possible configurations of power, LEDs and LED control circutry.<br/><br/>
<img style="max-width: 20em;" src="content/syndra/v1/IMG_7986.jpg"></img><br/>
<br/>

<h3>waste of time</h3>
Only once I had received the board from JLCPCB did I think to actually build a physical model to see how the final badge might feel. I reazlied immedietly that with AA batteries it would be way too heavy and awkward, not at all like the thin small badge Tom had at NFC. So I drastically changed plan to instead use Lipo batteries (because they are smaller) and to go for USB charging. At least I learned a bunch of stuff about PCB design :v.<br/><br/>

<br/>

<h3>touching grass</h3>
With this setback, I took a hiatus from the project to go think about life for a bit. ._.<br/><br/>
<img style="max-width: 20em;" src="content/syndra/v1/grass.jpg"></img><br/>
<br/>

<h3>panic</h3>
Realizing next NFC was drawing closer and closer, with the goal of having the project done before then, I got to work again, making a couple 3D-print experiments for the case that the badge might eventually would go in. <br/><br/>I then started working out a new and improved general design of the board, involving splitting it into two separate boards, one board with the Display one it, and one with the Microcontroller, power, etc on it. Which also meant I can test them separately. I also found a nice battery charging breakout board that I could use for charging the battery<br/><br/>

<br/>

<h3>woah something is working</h3>
At this point, Maple introdced me to Ferix, (electrical engineer) who could help answer questions more in-depth. I started prototyping on a breadboard, using some Multiplexers, Shift Registers and en ESP32 dev board. After some tinkering I found this worked really well! and decided to go ahead with this general design.<br/><br/>

<br/>

<h3>smells like burning flux</h3>
I designed out and ordered a dispaly board, placing pads around the edges for connecting it. It turns out I made the pads way too small, so soldering them was a bit of a pain. But with some effort, I managed to get it connected to the breadboard and powered up.<br/><br/>

<br/>

<h3>first light</h3>
I started harassing Ferix for real, especially about power, and he gave me the advice to pick whatever power converter is the most popular, and walked me through configuring it! I put all of this power circutry on a small board and ordered it, just to make sure it would actually work. Luckily it did! I also put an accelorometer on this board to play with.<br/><br/>

<br/>

<h3>let's fucking go</h3>
At this point I started designing the control board, taking everything on the breadboard and "minifying" it to fit on the final PCB. I had to make the PCB bigger than originally intended to easily fit all the components. With some anxiety, I ordered the board an put it together. After some fiddling and accidentaly shorting random stuff, it worked!<br/>
I also started working on the software "for real" at this point, making a fun physics toy, scrolling text and a settings page.<br/><br/>

<br/>

<h3>so cool</h3>
Happy the control board seemed to be working, I ordered the final verison of the LED array, soldered it to the PCB and tested to make sure it was all still working. I needed to add a bodge capacitor and a couple extra wires to get it all working right and I accidentally broke one of the switches. But there was (luckily) no unfixable failure.<br/><br/>

<img style="max-width: 20em;" src="content/syndra/v1/IMG_0469.jpg"></img><br/>
<br/><br/>

<h3>productizing</h3>
Pretty soon, and with the deadline looming I finished up the software, and 3D-printed a case for it.<br/><br/>
